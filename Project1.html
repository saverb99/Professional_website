								<h2>Development and deployment of a fully printed 126-channel MXene µECoG array captures pathological and auditory-evoked cortical activity in intraoperative recordings from human neurosurgical patients</h2>
							</header>
								<p> This work presents a fully direct-ink-write (DIW) printed neurotechnology platform for rapidly producing high-resolution, flexible electrocorticography (ECoG) arrays with clinically relevant performance. By integrating printable, low-temperature-curing polyimide substrates, additive-free Ti₃C₂Tₓ MXene ink for conductive traces and contacts, and PDMS encapsulation, the platform supports multi-material, multi-layer fabrication using a single toolchain. Each layer is deposited via DIW, enabling seamless integration of materials and rapid design iteration without reliance on photolithography or cleanroom infrastructure. </p>
								<p> A key early component of this work involved systematic optimization of the ink-substrate pairing. Through direct comparison of trace morphology, conductivity, and feature definition across a range of substrates and MXene concentrations, we identified a highly printable PI substrate and a 42 mg/mL Ti₃C₂Tₓ dispersion as an optimal combination. This pairing yielded sharply defined traces with excellent adhesion, low spreading, and reproducible conductivity - providing a reliable foundation for high-resolution DIW patterning. </p>
								<p> Using this formulation, we fabricated and validated a 126-channel micro-ECoG array as a proof of concept. The array features 500 µm diameter electrode contacts spaced 3 mm apart and exhibits strong electrochemical performance, including a low impedance at 1 kHz (1.3 ± 0.2 kΩ), high charge storage capacity, and favorable charge injection limits - all meeting or exceeding benchmarks for cortical neural recording and stimulation. These results were consistent across devices and were achieved without requiring any chemical additives or post-processing beyond a low-temperature annealing step. </p>
								<p> Importantly, the DIW process achieves 250 µm feature resolution over a ~150 cm³ workspace, enabling rapid and customizable design of array geometries and material stacks. The speed and flexibility of this platform position DIW as an enabling method for high-throughput prototyping and scalable manufacturing of neural interfaces tailored to specific anatomical targets or experimental needs. </p>
								<p> The functionality of the DIW-printed arrays was validated in both preclinical and clinical settings. In rodents, the devices supported stable broadband cortical recordings and elicited hindlimb movements via electrical stimulation. In an intraoperative human case, the arrays captured both spontaneous epileptiform spikes and auditory-evoked high-gamma activity from temporal cortex - confirming the translational readiness of these devices. </p>
								<p> More broadly, this work establishes a modular, adaptable, and scalable paradigm for neural interface development. The DIW platform shortens the design-to-deployment cycle to under 24 hours and lowers the barrier to fabrication, opening new opportunities in personalized neurotechnology. Future directions include extending this framework to chronically implantable systems, integrating multimodal sensing, and exploring closed-loop stimulation strategies. Together, these findings and innovations underscore the potential of DIW-printed MXene platforms to accelerate the translation of bioelectronic interfaces from lab bench to clinic and beyond. </p>
